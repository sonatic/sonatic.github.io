      The plan is to get an "about" page on there to provide more information,
      and then get the v0 out ASAP.

    <p>
      A few weeks ago I really wanted something that would just play a basic
      slideshow of pictures with a speed control. Somehow I couldn't find
      anything that fit the vision I had, so I worked with chatGPT to make one
      for myself. I don't have it hosted anywhere, but simply open Terminal on
      my computer and type "slideshow" and a bash script runs that starts it up
      for me.
